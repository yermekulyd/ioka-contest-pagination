# Pagination Component

This project is a responsive `React` application that implements a pagination component alongside a data table. The pagination component is built using `TypeScript` and `SCSS`, adhering to modern web development standards. It includes adaptive features for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup and running, and highlights the key features implemented as part of the test assignment.
